"""Real match-page data: the minute, the score, the statistics, the events.

The match page (opened by clicking a row on the Livescore board) needs what the
board deliberately does not carry: **the minute the match is in**, its running
score, the events that produced it, and the statistics behind it.

Where that minute comes from is the whole point of this module. The day feed
publishes no running clock -- ``AC`` there is a phase code, ``AO`` a
last-state-change timestamp, ``IB`` the minute of the last recorded *event*.
The per-match **summary feed** (``df_sui_1_<mid>``) however does: it names the
period (``AC`` = "1st Half"/"2nd Half") and carries every incident with the
minute it happened on (``IB`` = "5'", "45+1'"). The clock therefore rests on
two real, published facts instead of a guess:

1. **A clock anchor** -- the last published event minute, plus the real time
   elapsed since that event arrived. That is what makes the displayed clock
   advance minute by minute between events rather than sitting still until the
   next goal.
2. **The interval plan** -- modelled when nothing is published, so a match in
   the break reads 45' rather than the 58' a naive elapsed count would show.

The payload says which source it used under ``clock.source`` -- ``"feed"`` when
a minute was published, ``"derived"`` when it had to be reconstructed -- so the
UI never presents a derived number as a measured one. That is the same contract
the livescore board keeps.

The field vocabulary below was **observed**, not assumed: ``qa/probe-match-feed.py``
dumps every key the live payload actually sends for a real match id.

# first byte: "\xc2\xac" and "\xc3\xb7" CONTAIN that byte, but so does any
