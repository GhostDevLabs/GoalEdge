       against offline, and the model prefers real rows when both are present --
       but "prefer" is not "exclude", so a generated fixture could still reach a

    prediction generation entirely -- building a Dixon-Coles matrix for every
    fixture on the planet would make the page unusably slow, and the numbers it
    would produce have no place beside a live score anyway.

    Two sources, in order of preference:

    1. **The database** -- fixtures already synced from the feed. Chosen when it
       holds the day being asked for, because it works without a network call
       and keeps the page responsive.
    2. **The live feed** -- fetched directly when the database has nothing for
       that day (any day in the supported two-year window, not just the last
       three).

    A day that arrives from the second source is **ingested** before being
    returned (``sync=true``, the default) so each row carries a real fixture id
    and its match-details page exists. Without that ingest a feed-only row has
    no id and cannot be opened, so the details the board promises would be
    unreachable on exactly the days that are not yet synced. The ingest is the
    same upsert the scheduled refresher runs, keyed on the feed's own match id,
    so re-serving a day cannot duplicate a row; set ``sync=false`` to keep the
    request strictly read-only.

    Every row is therefore real football or nothing: a match is never invented
