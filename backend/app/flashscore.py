"""Flashscore fixture source — real matches, dates, kick-off times and results.

The app's seeded fixtures are simulated. This module pulls the **real** football
schedule for a given day from Flashscore's public day feed and normalises it into
a stable shape the rest of the app can consume, so the Results page grades actual
football rather than generated scorelines.

Feed format
-----------
A Flashscore day feed (``/x/feed/f_1_<day>_3_<lang>_1``) is a flat text blob of
``KEY÷value`` pairs joined by ``¬``, with records separated by ``~``:

* A competition header record carries ``ZA`` (labelled name, e.g.
  ``"ENGLAND: Premier League"``), ``ZY`` (country) and ``ZEE`` (competition id).
* Each following match record carries ``AA`` (match id), ``AD`` (kick-off as a
  Unix timestamp), ``FH``/``AF`` (home/away team), ``OA``/``OB`` (crest files),
  ``AB`` (status) and — once played — ``AG``/``AH`` (final goals).

Status codes (verified against live payloads, not guessed):

======
``AB``  meaning
======
``1``   scheduled
``2``   live
``3``   finished
======

Only ``AG``/``AH`` hold the real full-time score; ``AW``/``BW``/``AX``/``BX``
are team-ordering slots that are present on *unplayed* matches too, so reading
them as goals would invent 0-0 results. They are deliberately ignored.

The feed token is a request header the public endpoint itself expects. It is not
a credential and grants no account access.

#: minutes. 105 + 10 = 115, and the bound is set a minute past that so a match
#: in its final minute of stoppage is still shown as live rather than cut off
#: one minute early. Past it the match is over -- the feed has simply not closed
#: the row -- and a clock still reading "90+11'" there reads as a bug.
#:
#: This bound is deliberately inside the old 120-minute figure: the gap between
#: them was exactly the window in which a finished match displayed "90+15'"
#: instead of full time, because `MAX_STOPPAGE_MINUTES` (15) is a ceiling no
#: referee reaches and the clock kept counting up to it before the match was
#: declared over. Real stoppage tops out around 10, so declaring full time at
#: 116 real minutes still never clips genuine added time.

    Two feed *variants* are merged, because neither is complete on its own. The
    ``_3_`` variant is the one this app has always read; the ``_2_`` variant is
    broader and is the only one that carries the major European leagues -- on a
    day with Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 fixtures in
    play, ``_3_`` returned none of them while ``_2_`` returned all five. Reading
    either alone therefore silently omits real football: ``_3_`` hides the top
    leagues, ``_2_`` is thinner on the rest of the world.

    Merging is by the feed's own match id (``AA``), so a match appearing in both
    variants -- most do -- is counted once. The ``_3_`` entry wins on a clash
    because it is the variant the app's other fields were validated against.
