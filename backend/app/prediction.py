"""Statistical prediction engine.

Core model: a Dixon-Coles adjusted bivariate Poisson.

    1. Estimate each team's attack / defence rating from its recent results
       (recency-weighted, shrunk toward the league mean with a Bayesian prior
       so a team with 3 games played isn't ranked like a 30-game side).
    2. Convert ratings into expected goals for the fixture.
    3. Build the full scoreline matrix 0..MAX_GOALS using Poisson marginals
       with the Dixon-Coles tau correction for low-scoring results
       (0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 1-1) which a plain Poisson over/under-predicts.
    4. Derive 1X2, Over/Under and BTTS probabilities from the matrix.
    5. Blend with bookmaker implied probabilities (removing the overround)
       so a short-priced favourite isn't outranked by a raw longshot.
    6. Flag value where blended probability beats the de-vigged market price.
