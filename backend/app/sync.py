"""Sync real Flashscore fixtures into the database.

This is the bridge between :mod:`app.flashscore` (which fetches and parses the
live feed) and the rest of the app (which reads the ``Fixture`` table). It
upserts the competitions, teams and matches a real day contains, so the
Predictions feed and the Results page describe actual football.

Deduplication is by ``external_id`` (the feed's own match id), so syncing the
same day repeatedly updates kick-off times, statuses and scores in place rather
than creating duplicates. That matters because a day is re-synced constantly:
matches move from scheduled to live to finished during it.

Real fixtures are tagged ``source="flashscore"`` and kept separate from the
simulated ``source="seed"`` dataset.

Rating history
--------------
A prediction is only as good as the team ratings behind it, and those are fitted
from finished results. Real clubs arrived with no history at all, so every side
sat at the neutral 1.0 and the engine could not separate a title contender from a
relegation side.

:func:`import_team_history` closes that gap: for each real fixture it pulls the
teams' recent form from Flashscore's ``df_hh`` feed and stores those finished
matches as real fixtures too. The ratings are then fitted to **real results
only**, and simulated ``seed`` results are excluded from rating real teams -- a
synthetic scoreline must never shape a real prediction.
