// where a left-to-right axis needs one per player, and `LL` is a display order
// (1..11). So the shape comes from the formation string and the order within a
// line is the feed's own record order. Nothing here claims to be a measured x/y.
//
// The orientation matches the reference board: the pitch is landscape, the two
// sides attack EACH OTHER across the halfway line, and the two keepers stand at
// the outer edges (left and right), not top and bottom. Each side's lines are
// read keeper -> defence -> attack moving INWARD from its own goal, so the two
// attacks meet in the middle. That is the one arrangement a pitch diagram must
// get right, and stacking the halves vertically (the previous layout) put both
// keepers on the halfway line instead of on their own goal lines.
//
// The `mp-pitch-half-{home,away}` class is what flips the reading order: the
// away side's own half is mirrored, so the same markup renders one side either
// end of the single field.

// The reference colours a player's rating note by BAND rather than printing one
// flat amber, so a good game and a poor one do not look alike. The thresholds
// are the reference's own (measured off its live board): blue at 8.0+, dark green

// operator's palette. That is the honest reading -- an operator recolouring the
// brand green expects it in both themes.
//
